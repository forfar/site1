<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Are you looking for a cost effective extension in the West Yorkshire area and&nbsp;shocked by&nbsp;ridiculous quotes?</strong></h1>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I head an experienced team of builders who have many years experience in building using traditional methods.</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We are looking into moving into building with SIPs. You may have seen these on Grand Designs and other TV shows. Structural Insulated Panels are lightweight, strong and quick to build with. They also outperform traditional building methods when it comes to insulation.</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We have not constructed a SIP extension before but have a good contact with a manufacturer. We are looking for someone who would let us build them an extension using SIPs for COST PRICE!</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SIPs are manufactured with timber but can be made to look like anything externally; brick, stone or render. Also, the internal fit out and decoration is just the same as tradtional methods which we have significant experience in. Therefore you can be assured the work will be of good quality. The manufacturer of the panels offers a fully warranty, and we are fully insured.</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>In return for taking a (small) risk on our in-experience in panel-building, you will get a very affordable extension. It would be a good idea to collect a few quotes from other builders to give you an idea of how much you will save. We have done the calculations and are certain we can beat any quote for traditional building methods, but&nbsp;you will get a better product in a shorter time.</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>As a rough guide, we would expect to be able to offer a 4.0 x 4.0M rear kitchen extension to a semi-detached house for &pound;25,000 total.</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Drop me an email today to let me know what your requirements are and how I can contact you. We want this to be a transparent process, we would look to charge for the materials and a low day rate for labour and that's it. Most builders would add on profit and contingency to this. There is nothing wrong with that but we don't believe it would be appropriate whilst we are practising. This will a learning experience for us and a cost saving experience for you!</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cheers,</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Jim. </strong></h3>
